# Smart Waste Management System with Predictive Routing

IoT-based system that monitors waste bin fill levels in real time and uses machine learning to predict overflow and generate optimal collection routes (38–42% fuel saving).

## Features

- Real-time bin monitoring (ESP32 + ultrasonic sensors)
- Live web dashboard with Leaflet map (color-coded bins)
- ML prediction of fill-up time
- Dynamic route optimization
- Firebase Realtime Database backend
